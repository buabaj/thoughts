# /thoughts
> my digital engineering journal

## About me
If you're reading this, you probably already know me. But for those who don't, my name is jerry. I work in electronic trading engineering, building high-performance, fault-tolerant trading systems with an amazing team in London. My other interests are reading, photography and volunteering.

## Why here?
I have been learning so much over the last couple of months that I feel the need to keep a "mini" blog or journal, if you may. However, writing and posting to Medium has become so hard for me, and I'm still anxious about publishing to a big/redistributed platform. The plan for `/thoughts` is to become an extension of my handwritten notes, with code samples and architecture diagrams I want to share or keep track of. Also, free hosting :P

## Topics
I will be writing mostly about:
- APIs
- Parallelism and concurrency
- Low-latency programming
- Interoperability
- System design
- Monitoring and observability

I choose these topics because they are the ones I constantly learn about and work with. Most code I share here will be in:
- C++17/20/23
- Python (vanilla or with C++ bindings)
- Fortran
- Golang
- Rust

I'm also frequently learning about finance and taking short courses, so I might share some notes on that too.

## How to navigate
Over the coming days, these directories will be added:
- `drafts/` - Work in progress
- `assets/` - Images, diagrams, and other resources
- `notes/` - Finished notes and articles

All completed notes will be linked below in the `Posts` section.
